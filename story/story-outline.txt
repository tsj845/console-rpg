Long ago, a dragon named Kyramin ruled the town of Farcrest. 
The humans, knowing the power of the great dragon, made a
deal with him. The agreement was simple: the humans would provide 
support for Kyramin, and in exchange he would provide protection 
from the rivaling dragons coming from the underworld.

Now, over a thousand years later, Farcrest is in chaos. Kyramin is 
missing, and without his support, Farcrest cannot protect itself from
the incoming dragons. The town elders, Kyramin's consulters, have sent
you on a quest to find him, and there's only one place he could be:

The Underworld.
